# Udacity course CS373: Programming a Robotic Car

These are my notes/homework/tasks/whatnot from way back spring 2012. Putting them up so I have yet another backup somewhere. 
I would very much like to put all the Udacity provided materials here too but I suspect they would frown on that even if the course is free.

If you're on the course do not copy my code as is, you'll only cheat yourself... Feel free to copy ideas though.
