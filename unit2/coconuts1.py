# 5 guys, one monkey, pile of coconuts
# one by one a guy takes 1/5 of the (remaining) pile, but since the pile
# is not divisible by 5 gives one coconut to monkey.
# After this the remaining pile is divided to five parts (giving one coconut to monkey)
# monkey has now 6 coconuts, how many there were originally ?
