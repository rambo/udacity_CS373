# ----------
# User Instructions:
#
# Modify the the search function so that it returns
# a shortest path as follows:
# 
# [['>', 'v', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
#  [' ', '>', '>', '>', '>', 'v'],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'v'],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'v'],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '*']]
#
# Where '>', '<', '^', and 'v' refer to right, left, 
# up, and down motions. NOTE: the 'v' should be 
# lowercase.
#
# Your function should be able to do this for any
# provided grid, not just the sample grid below.
# ----------


# Sample Test case

        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

        [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]]
