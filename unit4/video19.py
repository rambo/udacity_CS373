# ----------
# User Instructions:
# 
# Implement the function optimum_policy2D() below.
#
# You are given a car in a grid with initial state
# init = [x-position, y-position, orientation]
# where x/y-position is its position in a given
# grid and orientation is 0-3 corresponding to 'up',
# 'left', 'down' or 'right'.
#
# Your task is to compute and return the car's optimal
# path to the position specified in `goal'; where
# the costs for each motion are as defined in `cost'.

# EXAMPLE INPUT:

# grid format:
#     0 = navigable space
#     1 = occupied space 
grid = [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
        [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]]
goal = [2, 0] # final position
init = [4, 3, 0] # first 2 elements are coordinates, third is direction
cost = [2, 1, 20] # the cost field has 3 values: right turn, no turn, left turn

# EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
# calling optimum_policy2D() should return the array
# 
# [[' ', ' ', ' ', 'R', '#', 'R'],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', '#', ' ', '#'],
#  ['*', '#', '#', '#', '#', 'R'],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', '#', ' ', ' '],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', '#', ' ', ' ']]
#
# ----------


# there are four motion directions: up/left/down/right
# increasing the index in this array corresponds to
# a left turn. Decreasing is is a right turn.

           [ 0, -1], # go left

forward_name = ['up', 'left', 'down', 'right']

# the cost field has 3 values: right turn, no turn, left turn
action = [-1, 0, 1]
